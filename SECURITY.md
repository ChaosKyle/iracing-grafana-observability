- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability

## Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

1. **Sensitive Data Handling**:
   - No hardcoded credentials in the codebase
   - All secrets are stored in environment variables
   - Environment files (.env) are never committed to the repository

2. **Docker Security**:
   - Non-root user used in containers where possible
   - Only necessary packages installed in containers
   - Image security scanning as part of CI/CD

3. **Code Security**:
   - Input validation on all user-supplied data
   - Dependency security scanning
   - Regular dependency updates for security patches

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after vulnerabilities are confirmed. Users will be notified through:

1. GitHub security advisories
2. Release notes
3. Notifications on the project's communication channels

## Best Practices for Users

To ensure your installation remains secure:

1. Always use the latest version of the project
2. Use strong, unique passwords for database and Grafana credentials
3. Restrict network access to your installation
4. Keep Docker and all dependencies up to date
5. Never expose your installation directly to the internet without proper security measures
